View kernel: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdJWang/EdJWang.github.io/blob/Web_Base/Projects/NBA.ipynb) <br>
This analysis dives into player generated data (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) from the National Basketball Association's 2018-2019 season. This analysis highlights predicting player salaries based on these performance metrics and identifying which factors were most important towards making these predictions. The dataset used in this analysis was extracted from this [Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019).
