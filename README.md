### Predicting NBA Player Salaries using Performance Metrics
View kernel: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdJWang/EdJWang.github.io/blob/Web_Base/Projects/NBA.ipynb) <br>
This analysis dives into player generated data from the National Basketball Association's 2018-2019 season. This analysis highlights predicting player salaries based on these performance metrics and identifying which factors were most important towards making these predictions. The dataset used in this analysis was extracted from this [Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019).
### An Exploratory Analysis on Online Chess Games

Lichess is a digital chess platform where players can compete with other chess players all across the world. The dataset which was analyzed is from this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) and compiles over 20,000 Lichess games together. This kernel graphically interprets the collection of chess games, providing visualizations on win rates, common chess openings, and the Lichess Elo distribution.
## R Projects
### Comparing Clustering Algorthims Using Simulated Data and the Iris Dataset

In this analysis, I experiment with several popular clustering algorithms and compare them against each other across several simulated 2-dimensional data patterns. All simulations and clustering algorithms are performed using the R programming languages and various R packages.
