### An Exploratory Analysis on Online Chess Games
View kernel: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdJWang/EdJWang.github.io/blob/Web_Base/Projects/Chess.ipynb) <br>
Lichess is a digital chess platform where players can compete with other chess players all across the world. The dataset which was analyzed is from this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) and compiles over 20,000 Lichess games together. This kernel graphically interprets the collection of chess games, providing visualizations on win rates, common chess openings, and the Lichess Elo distribution.
### Extreme Gradient Boosting to Predict Titanic Passenger Survivals
View kernel: <br>
The [Titanic Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) is widely known as one of the best beginner classification problems. This problem consists of predicting whether passengers have survived the Titanic crash based on their age, ticket fare, and plenty of other variables. In this kernel, I present my final solution to the problem which obtains an accuracy score of 79% on the test set and places in the top 10% of all submissions.
### Predicting NBA Player Salaries using Performance Metrics
View kernel: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdJWang/EdJWang.github.io/blob/Web_Base/Projects/NBA.ipynb) <br>
This analysis dives into player generated data from the National Basketball Association's 2018-2019 season. This analysis highlights predicting player salaries based on select performance metrics and identifying which factors were most important towards making these predictions. The dataset used in this analysis was extracted from this [Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019).
## R Projects
### Comparing Clustering Algorthims Using Simulated Data and the Iris Dataset
View kernel: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdJWang/EdJWang.github.io/blob/Web_Base/Projects/Cluster_Comparison.ipynb) <br>
In this analysis, I experiment with several popular clustering algorithms and compare them against each other across several simulated 2-dimensional data patterns. Finally, I'll compare these clustering algorithms in a real dataset with pre-defined classifications through the Iris Dataset.
### Performing Sentiment Analysis on Airline Reviews
View kernel: <br>
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique to assess the tone of voice in textual data. In this kernel, we perform 2 NLP algorithms to predict the sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) of tweets about various airlines. The original data source comes from [Appen](https://appen.com/resources/datasets/). However, this analysis uses the Excel version of the dataset made available on Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment).
